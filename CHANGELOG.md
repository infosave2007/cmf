# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] — 2026-07-07

### Added

- `cortiq serve --host <HOST>` to control the bind address (default `0.0.0.0`;
  set `127.0.0.1` for a local-only server).
- A `/healthz` liveness endpoint on the server — for process managers that embed
  `cortiq serve` as a local model backend (e.g. an LLM gateway).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-07

### Added

- `cortiq run --max-tokens <N>` (short `-n`) to cap the number of generated
  tokens (default 256); previously the generation length was fixed at 256.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-07

Initial public release.

### Added

- **`cortiq-core`** — the CMF v2 on-disk format: 128-byte envelope, section
  table, memory-mappable tensor directory, tokenizer and chat-template records,
  per-task mask records, and per-skill full-shape replacement-tensor delta
  records with a byte-offset delta index.
- **Quantization codecs** — including the two-field `q8_2f` (scale × phase)
  path and v-bit stacking, with golden round-trip and parity tests.
- **`cortiq-engine`** — a dependency-free runtime that memory-maps a container
  and runs inference on **CPU or GPU**. Overlay execution reads per-skill
  replacement tensors *in place of* the shared backbone at forward time without
  materializing a separate model. Optional `gpu` feature uses a portable wgpu
  backend (Vulkan / Metal / DX12) with CPU/GPU parity.
- **`cortiq-server`** — an optional axum-based HTTP serving layer.
- **`cortiq-cli`** — the `cortiq` command-line binary for inspecting, converting,
  and running containers.
- **Converters** — self-contained Python tooling to produce `.cmf` files from
  source models, plus a pure-Python reader for inspecting containers.
- **Documentation** — the CMF v2 specification and a comparison against GGUF,
  safetensors, ONNX, PyTorch `.pt`, GGML, and TensorRT, in English, Russian,
  and Chinese.
- **Developer tooling** — `Makefile` and `justfile` shortcuts, a pinned
  `rust-toolchain.toml`, GitHub Actions CI (build + test on Linux and macOS,
  clippy, rustfmt), and contributor / community-health docs
  (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue/PR templates).
- **Licensing** — Apache-2.0 with an explicit patent-grant explanation
  (`LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `PATENTS.md`).
